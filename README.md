# seg hub

Welcome to seg hub. This is a toolbox for semantic segmentation in python. The main idea is to combine multiple ways of feature extraction with a random forest classifier (and possibly other classification algorithms such as kmeans). The idea of combining a convolutional neural network for feature extraction with a random forest classifier originates from Lucien Hinderling of the pertzlab at the University of Bern, where I did my Master Thesis.

Please note that the intention behind seg_hub is not implement in fastest-possible solutions. Much rather it shall be a set of tools and ways to explore and compare different approaches to semantic segmentation.

**If you decide to use this tool or some of the code in any sort of public work, please do contact me and cite this repository. I would be excited.**

## Requirements

## Installation
You can install seg_hub via pip using

    pip install git+https://github.com/quasar1357/seg_hub.git

After this, you can simply import the functions needed in Python (e.g. `from dino_utils import get_dinov2_feature_space`).
